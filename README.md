# Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a MVC restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

## Purpose
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* All burgers and their devoured status are stored in a database.

## Getting Started

Visit the app:
